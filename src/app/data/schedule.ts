     Please note however that much of the day will be spent on uneven terrain and 
     grass so very high heels and stilletos may not be the best idea. 
     While Hannah did extensive research into average rainfall in Nantwich when choosing the date 
     it may also be wise to keep an eye on the weather and bring a warmer layer for later on.`,
